# :video_game: Ninja Gauntlet

 ## :clap: Introduction
 
 This is the landing page of our new video game at LBCLAB : Ninja Gauntlet.
 
 
 This page is hosted at the [LBCLAB center](https://lbclab.com/gauntlet/).
 On this landing page, you'll find game infos such as images (and beautiful parallax
 effects), release date but also a link to our [installer](https://lbclab.com/gauntlet/install)
 and the [documentation](https://github.com/LbcLab/docIndie) of the project which is hosted
 on our LBCLAB github organization such as this page you're reading right now.
 
 
 ## :shipit: :ship: Contribution
 
 Feel free to contribute to this project (especially LBCLAB members). The deployment
 will be handled by the system administrator. 
 
 
 There is no building process such as js uglification of image compression yet.
 You can contribute by working on the only index.html page. css/* and js/* are whole
 part of the project. vendor/* is for libraries
